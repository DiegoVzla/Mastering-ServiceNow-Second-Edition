#Mastering ServiceNow - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering ServiceNow - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-servicenow-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786465955), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
gs.info('Hello, world!');
```

ServiceNow is an enterprise SaaS platform. In order to work with the application, you will
need access to a ServiceNow instance, with system administrator access. The examples in
this book are about a custom application, but it is strongly recommended that any work be
performed in a sub-production instance. To make use of the source control integration and quickly download the code for each
chapter, you will need a free GitHub account. Sign up at https://www.github.com.
The examples have all been built with the Helsinki version of ServiceNow, released in
mid-2016. The concepts of ServiceNow are relevant for every version, but it is strongly
recommended that you follow along with a Helsinki instance
